# Hands On Machine Learning with Sci-kit Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Notes

This repository consists of my educational efforts furthering my education through the textbook "Hands On Machine Learning with Sci-kit Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron. The book provides a hands-on approach to learning machine learning with Python, using the popular libraries scikit-learn, Keras, and TensorFlow.
This code represent various projects that I have completed while learning these tools.
